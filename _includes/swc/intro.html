  Signals communicate information. Signal processing separates unimportant from important information in a signal to make relevant information easily accessible. Biomedical signal processing extracts useful information from biological signals, such as the pattern found in a CT scan.  The goal is to eliminate noise from the signal by designing filters that best separate signal from noise. Identifying and measuring features that best characterize the information of interest in a signal is another goal of signal processing.
